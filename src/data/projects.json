Sadly I had a lot to do in college so I couldn't update the script to be better but on my winter break in a mere two days I made an updated version which wouldn't have you go to coins outside the map or 'false positions' as I used to call it. Then in I think 4 or 5 days I created the Free Script which is a mm2 hub. I WILL NOT BE UPDATING the hub and will focus on better techniques/functions to collect coins;",
